# main_stack

The main stack within `mapaction_controller` exists in two modules; this one and steps.py. Each individual
step is represented by a Step object, which is a wrapper for:

* A function to run (which must accept kwargs**).
* A definition of a "running", "success" and "failure" message.
* A severity of failure.

The main function in main_stack.py is `process_stack()`, which works through a list of "Step" objects. For
each Step:

    * Its function is called.
    * The function may return:
        - One or more new Step objects (which are inserted into the slack). Closures are very useful here
        - An updated state object (which will passed to the next step)
    * Each Step defines each of a "running", "success" and "failure" message, which is displayed on the
      console and/or log as appropriate.


Execution continous until there are no more Steps.

Note: main_stack.py also includes humanfriendly.terminal which ought really to be part of the CLI.
